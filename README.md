# Nimbus

**Nimbus** is a powerful and scalable platform for converting images on-the-fly using the Sharp library. By simply providing a URL string, users can dynamically resize, crop, and transform images, which are then delivered through a custom architecture built on Vercel and Cloudflare. The original images are stored securely in AWS S3.

## Features

- **Dynamic Image Processing**: Convert and transform images using URL parameters.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on top of Vercel and Cloudflare for fast and reliable delivery.
- **Secure Storage**: Images are securely stored in AWS S3.
- **High Performance**: Leveraging the Sharp library for efficient image processing.

    cd nimbus
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash

    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

    ```env
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
    S3_REGION=your_s3_region
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

Alternatively, use it from [https://nimbus.sbn.lol/](https://nimbus.sbn.lol/) with the UI.


## Usage
